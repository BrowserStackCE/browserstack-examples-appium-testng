# BrowserStack Examples Appium TestNG

## Introduction

TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful.

This BrowserStack Example repository demonstrates an Appium test framework written in TestNG with parallel testing capabilities. The Appium test scripts are written for the open source [todo](todo). This BrowserStack Demo Mobile App is an e-commerce mobile application which showcases multiple real-world user scenarios. The app is bundled with offers data, orders data and products data that contains everything you need to start using the app and run tests out-of-the-box.

The Appium tests are run on different platforms like on-prem and BrowserStack using various run configurations and test capabilities.

| Login    | LoginFailTest                   | This test verifies the login workflow error. |
| Login    | LoginDataDrivenTest             | This test verifies the login for all error cases in a datadriven way |
| Login    | LoginDataDrivenReadFromCSVTest  | This test verifies the login for all error cases in a datadriven way with CSV-file  |
| Login    | LoginRequestedTest              | This test verifies that the login page is shown when you access the favourites page with being logged in  |
| Offers   | OfferTest                       | This test mocks the GPS location for Singapore and verifies that the product offers applicable for the Singapore location are shown.   |
| User     | UserTest                        | The first test verifies that existing orders are shown for user: "existing_orders_user". The second test verifies if a user can add product to the favourites. |

## Test infrastructure environments

- [On-premise/self-hosted](#on-premise-self-hosted)
- [BrowserStack](#browserstack)


## Configuring the maximum parallel test threads for this repository

For all the parallel run configuration profiles, you can configure the maximum parallel test threads by changing the settings below.

- BrowserStack

  Maven:

  `pom.xml`
  ```xml
  <testng.parallel>classes</testng.parallel>
  <testng.threadCount>5</testng.threadCount>
  ```

  Gradle:

  `gradle.properties`
  ```sh
  testngParallel=classes
  testngThreadCount=5
  ```

## Test Reporting

- [Allure reports](#generating-allure-reports)

---

# On Premise / Self Hosted

This infrastructure points to running the tests on your own machine using simulator or connected devices.

## Prerequisites

- For this infrastructure configuration (i.e on-premise), ensure that the app is downloaded and placed in the `/src/test/resources/app` folder.
<todo add download urls>

## Running Your Tests

### Run a specific test on your own machine

- How to run the test?

  To run the default test scenario (e.g. End to End Scenario) on your own machine, use the following command:

  Maven:
    ```sh
  mvn clean test -P on-prem
  ```

  Gradle:
    ```sh 
  gradle clean on-prem
  ```

  To run a specific test scenario, use the following command with the additional 'test' argument:

  Maven:
  ```sh
  mvn clean test -P on-prem -Dtest=LoginDataDrivenTest

  ```

  Gradle:
  ```sh
  gradle clean on-prem -Ptest-name=LoginDataDrivenTest
  ```

  where, the argument `test` or `test-name` can be any testclass implemented this repository.

- Output

  This run profile executes a specific test scenario on a single device instance on your own machine.


### Run the entire test suite on your own machine

- How to run the test?

  To run the entire test suite on your own machine, use the following command:

  Maven:
  ```sh
  mvn clean test -P on-prem-suite
  ```

  Gradle:
  ```sh
  gradle clean on-prem-suite
  ```

- Output

  This run profile executes the entire test suite sequentially on a single device, on your own machine.

# BrowserStack

[BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) provides instant access to 2,000+ real mobile devices and browsers on a highly reliable cloud infrastructure that effortlessly scales as testing needs grow.

## Prerequisites

- Create a new [BrowserStack account](https://www.browserstack.com/users/sign_up) or use an existing one.
- Identify your BrowserStack username and access key from the [BrowserStack App Automate Dashboard](https://app-automate.browserstack.com/) and export them as environment variables using the below commands.

   - For \*nix based and Mac machines:

  ```sh
  export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<browserstack-username> &&
  export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=<browserstack-access-key>
  ```

   - For Windows:

  ```shell
  set BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<browserstack-username>
  set BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=<browserstack-access-key>
  ```

  Alternatively, you can also hardcode username and access_key objects in the [test_caps.json](resources/conf/capabilities/test_caps.json) file.

Note:
- We have configured a list of test capabilities in the [test_caps.json](resources/conf/capabilities/test_caps.json) file. You can certainly update them based on your device test requirements.
- The exact test capability values can be easily identified using the [Browserstack Capability Generator](https://browserstack.com/app-automate/capabilities)


## Running Your Tests on BrowserStack

### Prerequisites

You need to upload the `APK` or `IPA` to BrowserStack, before you can run the test on BrowserStack. BrowserStack will provide you with an `app_url` which you need to use.

You can upload the `APK` or `IPA` using a file on your filesystem or using a public url.

cURL command: 
``` shell
curl -u "browserstack_username:browserstack_access_key" \
-X POST "https://api-cloud.browserstack.com/app-automate/upload" \
-F "file=@/path/to/ipa/or/apk"
-F "custom_id=BrowserStackDemoApp"
```
